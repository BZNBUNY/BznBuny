## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**BZNBUNY/BznBuny** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

This is what it's all about:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on nothing and I'm bored
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Github because I'm bored
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything because I'm bored
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with money because I want some
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about nothing, as I'm too lazy to answer
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm old and cranky
